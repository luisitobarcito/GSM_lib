Matlab library for flexible normalization based on the mixture of
Gaussian Scale Mixture Model

This code implements the models described in:

L. Sanchez Giraldo and O. Schwartz. Integrating Flexible Normalization
into Mid-Level Representations of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.
To Appear in Neural Computation, 2019.

You should run the following command to add the relevant paths before
running your own scripts:  
>> run load_paths.m


See
"./examples/train_example_from_tensor_filelist.m"  for a demo script that
trains a normalization model.
"./examples/normalize_example_tensor_filelist.m"  for a demo script that
